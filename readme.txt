Here's a complete `README.md` for your **Inventory Management Web App** project. It includes everything from **tech stack**, **features**, **setup**, **flow**, **issues solved**, and **future updates**.

# 🧾 Inventory Management Web App

A full-stack inventory management system with role-based access. Users can register/login, view their own products, and optionally enter admin (CRUD) mode to add, update, or delete items — including image upload via Cloudinary.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack Used

### 🔹 Frontend:
- **React.js** – SPA with responsive design
- **Material-UI (MUI)** – UI components
- **Axios** – API requests
- **React Router DOM** – Routing

### 🔹 Backend:
- **Node.js + Express** – Server-side framework
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** – Database and modeling
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** – Auth tokens
- **Multer** – Handling file uploads
- **Cloudinary** – Storing product images
- **CORS** – Secure cross-origin requests

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 User registration & login (JWT based)
- 👤 User-specific product inventory
- 🔒 Admin (CRUD) mode protected with a second password
- 🖼️ Image upload using Cloudinary
- 📦 Product listing with details: name, price, option, and image
- 📲 Fully mobile responsive
- 🌐 Frontend hosted on **Vercel**, backend on **Render**

---

## 🔄 Flow of the Application

1. **User visits app** → lands on login page.
2. **Registers or logs in** → gets JWT token stored in localStorage.
3. **Dashboard loads** → user sees their product list.
4. **Wants to edit/add/delete?** → Enters Admin Mode by submitting CRUD password.
5. **In Admin Mode**:
   - Can add product (name, price, option, image)
   - Product image uploaded to **Cloudinary**
   - Product is saved in MongoDB with user ID
6. **Logout** → Tokens cleared from localStorage.

---

## 🧠 Key Decisions & Why

### 📤 Image Upload: Multer + Cloudinary
- **Multer** used to handle form-data and temporarily store file.
- **Cloudinary** used for hosting images (secure, fast CDN, easy APIs).
- After upload, the local file is removed using `fs.unlinkSync()`.

### 🛡️ CRUD Mode
- Separate password layer even after login.
- CRUD token issued only when valid password is entered.
- Secure operations like update/delete/add product are protected.

### 🧭 Deployment
- **Frontend** on **Vercel**: Free, fast CI/CD for React apps.
- **Backend** on **Render**: Simple setup, good free tier for APIs.

## ⚠️ Problems Faced & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Product added but not visible without refresh | Used state update callback `onProductAdded()` to update UI immediately |
| Cloudinary upload success but image not showing | Ensured correct image URL is saved and used directly (not prefixed with localhost) |
| Image not uploaded to Cloudinary | Ensured multer middleware ran before controller, and `req.file.path` used for upload |
| CORS errors on frontend | Whitelisted frontend URL on backend with full CORS setup |
| Refreshing backend deletes uploads/ folder | Solved by using Cloudinary for permanent storage |

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 🔧 Prerequisites:
- Node.js, npm
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Cloudinary account

### 🔨 Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
````

Create `.env`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloud_name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>
```

Run server:

```bash
node server.js
```

---

### 🌐 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

---

## 🌍 Deployment

### 🧩 Backend (Render)

* Create new Web Service
* Add environment variables
* Use `node server.js` as start command
* Add CORS: allow frontend Vercel URL

### 📦 Frontend (Vercel)

* Connect GitHub repo
* Set framework = React
* Ensure API URL in Axios is updated to Render domain

---

## 💡 Future Updates

* ✅ Edit/Delete products (UI + backend already set)
* 🧾 Sort/filter by category/price
* 🖼️ Live camera capture for product image
* 🔐 User roles (admin/user)
* 📊 Stats & charts for product count
* ⏳ Pagination for large inventories
